# Node 101: Introduction to Node.js
### Course Syllabus

#### Instructor
Ryan Lewis (rylewis@expedia.com)  
Cell: (615) 578-2369

#### Course Description
This course will introduce students to Node.js and programming in JavaScript. Some experience in JavaScript or programming is a plus, but not a requirement. By the end of the course, each student will have built an interactive hotel search application and understand many of the core concepts of Node.js.
 
#### Meeting Times and Office Hours
We will meet on Tuesdays starting 4/26 and ending on 6/21 from 2:30pm - 3:30pm. You will need to bring your laptop, and will more than likely want a notebook and writing implement. Since each session is only an hour long, please remember that your instructor will hold office hours Thursday from noon to 1pm in the Lower Lobby in Headquarters (invites will be sent soon) to answer any questions you may have.
 
#### Class Sessions and Homework
There will be some homework assignments, depending on the concepts. These won’t be “graded” but you will receive feedback and suggestions from the instructor, usually within a week’s time. Homework submissions will be done via GitHub, and the homework submission process will be demonstrated in class.

Please note that you may get frustrated at first and coding may seem very unclear, but if you stick with it, we promise, there will be an “ah ha” moment for you. Coding is not nearly as difficult as it seems, but it does take time. The most important thing for you to remember in this class is that THERE ARE NO STUPID QUESTIONS!!!
